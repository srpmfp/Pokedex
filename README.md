# Pokemon App

### Overview
---
This simple app leverages the [pokedex api](https://pokedexapi.com/) to generate a responsive list of the original 150 pokemon. 
This is meant to showcase the use of the bootstrap framework and asynchronus javascript using IIFE. 

### Features
---
Mobile first perspective
API integration- Gathering dynamic JSON information and parsing to different elements 
Keyboard Accessibility

    

### Languages, extensions, and environment utilized
- HTML
     - Semantic structure and inline bootstrap styles

- JavaScript
    - Asynchronus API calls, eventlisteners

-jQuery & Bootstrap   
    - DOM manipulation and modal interaction


- Prettier & Babel JS
    - Formatting and debugging JS

- Polyfill 
    - Crossbrowser support for newer or unsupported CSS features.


### Improvement Opportunities
---
* change size of pokemon buttons relative to the height of the pokemon when the "height link" is selected
* change the color of the button to reflect the type
* filter out the pokemon by the different pokémon versions (gold, crystal, red, blue, etc.)
* develop section in modal to show that pokémon's evolution path.

### Takeaways from project
---
This gave a good <b>foundational experience </b> with the  <u>bootstrap library,</u> getting familiarized with its strengths and weaknesses. In returning to this project<br>
it's nice to see how far making API calls and using CSS has progressed as a developer. Since I have leveraged React Bootstrap and Angular Materials I <br> 
feel confident and proud of the foundations this project set.
